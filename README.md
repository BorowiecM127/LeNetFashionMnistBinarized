# LeNetFashionMnistBinarized
This is a repository for 'Projekt Grupowy' classes.  
Our task was to apply the binarization procedures to some kind CNN model,  
and measure accuracy and performance of the model with and without binarization.  
We decided to implement a LeNet model using Keras framework,  
and train it on a Fashion MNIST dataset.  
Binarization had a negative impact on our model,  
causing loss of accuracy approx. 10% (95% without binarizing, 85% with binarized input).
