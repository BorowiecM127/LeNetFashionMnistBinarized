# LeNetFashionMnistBinarized
## Overview
This is a repository for 'Projekt Grupowy' classes.  
Our task was to apply the binarization procedures to some kind CNN model,  
and measure accuracy of the model with and without binarization layers.  
We decided to implement a LeNet model using Keras framework,  
and train it on a Fashion MNIST dataset.  
  
## Results
Binarization had a negative impact on our model,  
causing loss of accuracy on up to approx. 10%, at least with training dataset.

On test dataset loss of accuracy is less noticeable.  
Also, binarization has advantages in case of memory usage.  
For detailed results, please check paper.
